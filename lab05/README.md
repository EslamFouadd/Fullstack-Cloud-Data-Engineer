# Running Apache Spark jobs on Dataproc

In this lab you will learn how to migrate Apache Spark code to Cloud Dataproc. You will follow a sequence of steps progressively moving more of the job components over to GCP services:

Run original Spark code on Cloud Dataproc (Lift and Shift)

Replace HDFS with Cloud Storage (cloud-native)

Automate everything so it runs on job-specific clusters (cloud-optimized)

# What you'll learn
In this lab you will learn how to:

Migrate existing Spark jobs to Cloud Dataproc

Modify Spark jobs to use Cloud Storage instead of HDFS

Optimize Spark jobs to run on Job specific clusters

# What you'll use
