# Loading Taxi Data into Google Cloud SQL

In this lab you will import data from CSV text files into Cloud SQL and then carry out some basic data analysis using simple queries.

# Overview
In this lab, you will learn how to import data from CSV text files into Cloud SQL and then carry out some basic data analysis using simple queries.

The dataset used in this lab is collected by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission and includes trip records from all trips completed in Yellow and Green taxis in NYC from 2009 to present, and all trips in for-hire vehicles (FHV) from 2015 to present. Records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

This dataset can be used to demonstrate a wide range of data science concepts and techniques and will be used in several of the labs in the Data Engineering curriculum.
