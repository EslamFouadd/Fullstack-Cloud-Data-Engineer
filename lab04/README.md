# Working with JSON and Array data in BigQuery

In this lab you will work with semi-structured data (ingesting JSON, Array data types) inside of BigQuery. You will practice loading, querying, troubleshooting, and unnesting various semi-structured datasets.

# Overview
BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.

This lab is an in-depth walkthrough of working with semi-structured data (ingesting JSON, Array data types) inside of BigQuery. Denormalizing your schema into a single table with nested and repeated fields can yield performance improvements, but the SQL syntax for working with array data can be tricky. You will practice loading, querying, troubleshooting, and unnesting various semi-structured datasets.

# Objectives
In this lab, you learn about the following:

Loading semi-structured JSON into BigQuery

Creating and querying arrays

Creating and querying structs

Querying nested and repeated fields
