# Using BigQuery to do Analysis

In this lab you analyze 2 different public datasets, run queries on them, separately and then combined, to derive interesting insights.

# Overview
In this lab you analyze 2 different public datasets, run queries on them, separately and then combined, to derive interesting insights.

# What you'll learn
In this lab, you will:

Carry out interactive queries on the BigQuery console.

Combine and run analytics on multiple datasets.

# Introduction

This lab uses two public datasets in BigQuery: weather data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and bicycle rental data from New York City.

You will encounter, for the first time, several aspects of Google Cloud Platform that are of great benefit to scientists:

Serverless. No need to download data to your machine in order to work with it - the dataset will remain on the cloud.

Ease of use. Run ad-hoc SQL queries on your dataset without having to prepare the data, like indexes, beforehand. This is invaluable for data exploration.

Scale. Carry out data exploration on extremely large datasets interactively. You don't need to sample the data in order to work with it in a timely manner.

Shareability. You will be able to run queries on data from different datasets without any issues. BigQuery is a convenient way to share datasets. Of course, you can also keep your data private, or share them only with specific persons -- not all data need to be public.

The end-result is that you will find if there are lesser bike rentals on rainy days.

# Summary

In this lab you did ad-hoc queries on two datasets. You were able to query the data without setting up any clusters, creating any indexes, etc. You were also able to mash up the two datasets and get some interesting insights. All without ever leaving your browser!
